### Hi there, I'm Angela ðŸ‘‹

#### A little bit about me ...

ðŸŽ“ &emsp;I'm a fourth year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
ðŸ’™ &emsp;I'm a developer for [UW Blueprint](https://uwblueprint.org), a student organization that builds tech projects for non-profits. I'm currently working on building a web application for Richmond Centre for Disability. [Check it out](https://github.com/uwblueprint/richmond-centre-for-disability)!<br>
ðŸ’» &emsp;I'm currently intering at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/), and have previously completed SWE internships at [LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com), [RBC](https://www.rbc.com/canada.html), [Connected](https://www.connected.io/) and [Tangam Systems](https://www.tangamsystems.com/).<br>
ðŸŒ± &emsp;I love all things environment and sustainability!
